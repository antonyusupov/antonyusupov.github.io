                            <h1>Extrusion</h1>
                            <p>Extrusion is the deformation of either metal or plastic forced under pressure through a die to create a shape. Part of the Fundamental Manufacturing Processes Video Series, this unique program is an introduction to both plastic extrusion and metal extrusion processes.

                                The metal extrusion segment looks at hot extrusion, press components, lubrication, force capacity, and the metals that are typically hot extruded. Both warm and cold extrusion processes are featured, including indirect extrusion, combination extrusion, and impact extrusion.

                                The plastic extrusion segment explores components of the screw extrusion machine and common feedstock and materials. The two most prevalent plastic extrusion processes, profile extrusion and blown film extrusion, are also extensively detailed.</p>

                            <p>Pelletizing is the most widely used process for the size reduction of many thermoplastic materials, including raw polymers and mixed compounds. The process involves extrusion through a die. The extrudate is cooled to solidification and then cut into pellets, or the molten extrudate is cut as it emerges from the extrusion die and the pellets are subsequently cooled. In the latter case, both cutting and cooling can be done in air or water, or cutting may be done in air, followed by quenching in water.<br><b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/pelletizer">What is Pelletizing Line Extrusion?</a></b></p>

                            <h2>Plastic Recycling</h2>
                            <p>Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products. Due to purposefully misleading symbols on plastic packaging and numerous technical hurdles, less than 10% of plastic has ever been recycled. Compared with the lucrative recycling of metal, and similar to the low value of glass recycling, plastic polymers recycling is often more challenging because of low density and low value.

                                Materials recovery facilities are responsible for sorting and processing plastics. As of 2019, due to limitations in their economic viability, these facilities have struggled to make a meaningful contribution to the plastic supply chain. The plastics industry has known since at least the 1970s that recycling of most plastics is unlikely because of these limitations.<br> However, the industry has lobbied for the expansion of recycling while these companies have continued to increase the amount of virgin plastic being produced.
                                
                                When different types of plastics are melted together, they tend to phase-separate, like oil and water, and set in these layers. The phase boundaries cause structural weakness in the resulting material, meaning that polymer blends are useful in only limited applications. This is in part, why the plastics industry has developed the resin identification codes. The two most widely manufactured plastics, polypropylene and polyethylene, behave this way, which limits their utility for recycling. Each time plastic is recycled, additional virgin materials must be added to help improve the integrity of the material. So, even recycled plastic has new plastic material added in.<br> Moreover, the same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2–3 times. Thus, even when plastics have a resin code, or are collected for recycling, only a small portion of that material is actually recycled. For example, as of 2017, only 8% of US plastic was recycled.
                                
                                Since almost all plastic is non-biodegradable, recycling can be part of reducing plastic in the waste stream. This is important, for example, for reducing the approximately 8 million metric tons of waste plastic that enters the Earth's ocean every year. However, because of the complexity of recycling, a substantial amount of plastic that is collected for recycling is processed in other ways, such as through trash incineration, or not processed at all.<br> <b><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/recycling-plastics-820356">How plastic recycling works?</a></b><br><b><a href="https://www.treehugger.com/benefits-of-plastic-recycling-1204142">Benefits Of Recycling Plastic</a></b></p>
